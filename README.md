# E-Learning-Management


The E-Learning Management System is a modular, console-based Java application built to simulate an online education platform.
It allows students to enroll in courses, complete assignments, and take quizzes, while instructors can create content, manage submissions, and evaluate student performance.
This project emphasizes core object-oriented programming (OOP) principles like abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and interface implementation, making it a perfect model for real-world educational systems.
